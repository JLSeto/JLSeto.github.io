  excerpt: This is a project demo of the CC2650 SensorTag. The SensorTag advertises it's sensor data over Bluetooth Low Energy. The TI SensorTag App is used
   to read the data and then it push to IBM's cloud.
   Our local server pulls the data from IBM's cloud, and displays it on a local webpage.

  excerpt: In this project, a client device reads sensor data from an Arduino101 via BLE and sends that data over wifi to a server where
   the data gets stored in a database and displayed on a webpage in real time.
   The user is also able to control the sampling rate of the Arduino101 with a click of a button from the webpage.
