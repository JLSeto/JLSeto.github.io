## Overview:
Texas Instrument's CC2650 SensorTag is a sensor that captures real world data such as acceleration and temperature and allows for quick IoT programming.  The SensorTag is easily configured to connect to TI's SensorTag application on your phone via bluetooth.  The app displays the captured data freely to the user, and also allows you to forward that data to IBM's Quick start server via wifi with a switch of a button.  IBM's platform can then be used to analyze the data as well as write and host our IoT application.  However, in this project, Node-Red and Websockets are used to pull the data from IBM's website and display it in our own website.

## How it Works:
Node.js is used as my server and integrates <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-Red</a> - a programming tool with a graphical interface that allows you to just connect programming objects like a flow diagram.  To retrieve data from IBM's platform in Node-red, I mainly use then <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-scx-ibmiotapp">ibmiotapp</a> module, and then connect that to my websocket module which sends the data to my server. The server then forwards that data via websockets to my website where the raw values are displayed.  Google Charts is configured to graph the data in x, y, and z acceleration data in real time.
