## Overview
This project is an IoT Demo of Texas Instrument's CC650 SensorTag using Node Red and Websockets.  The project works by connecting TI's SensorTag over Bluetooth Low Energy to your phone. The phone then sends the data over wifi to a IBM's Quick Start Server where the sensor data is displayed freely to the user.  From here you can use IBM's IoT platform to write and host your application.  However, in this example, the sensor data is pulled from IBM's Quickstart page and used in our local Application.

## Hardware Used:
Texas Instruments CC2650 SensorTag
SmartPhone with "TI SensorTag" Application
Laptop with Linux (Ubuntu OS)

## Software:
Node.js, Node Red
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
