This project was done during my Senior Year of College in Fall of 2015.  The project is pretty simple given that we just had to buy the Hardware, and the Middleware used was open source.
We also used Node Red which handled nearly all the programming needed for this project.

## How It Works:
The SensorTag connect via Bluetooth Low Energy to the SmartPhone.  Texas Instruments Application updates that data to IBM Cloud.  
We pull that information from the cloud to our local website.  Node

## Hardware:
Texas Instruments CC2560 SensorTag
SmartPhone with "TI SensorTag" Application
Laptop

## Software:
Node.js, Node Red
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
