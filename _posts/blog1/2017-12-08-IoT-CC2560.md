title: "IoT with Texas Instrument CC2560 SensorTag"

## Background
This project is an IoT Demo of Texas Instrument's (TI) CC2560 SensorTag with Node Red that I did during my Senior Year of College back in 2015.  The project works by connecting TI's SensorTag over Bluetooth Low Energy (ble) to your phone.  When connected, the phone receives the sensor data outputted by the SensorTag and then sends that data over wifi to the server.  Node.js and Node Red were used for the backend while HTML and CSS were used for the front end.  When looking at this project from the hardware level up, the project is quite complicated if one had to design all the hardware components and software needed.  However, given that the hardware and middleware was pretty much given to me, it was more or so just a matter of doing a little coding and connecting all the pieces together.

## TLDR / How it Works:
CC2560 Sensortag sends data over bluetooth to an App. App sends data over wifi to the server. Server processes data and displays on webpage.

## Hardware Used:
Texas Instruments CC2560 SensorTag
SmartPhone with "TI SensorTag" Application
Laptop

## Software Used:
Node.js, Node Red
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
